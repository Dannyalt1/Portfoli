        <img src="images/Wave3.gif" alt="Hover GIF" class="section-title-gif">
        <p>HELLO!!! My name is Dandreb B. Altavano, I am a student of Golden Link College for 10-11 years. I am 15 years old and I am currently on the ninth grade.</p>
        <p>As of the moment I don't have any occupations cause I'm still too young to work. I consider myself an above average student because I don't struggle as much in terms of academics. It is rare for me to get a failing grade but it is also rare for me to get an A in my grade card. And also be able to keep up with other students in class, and sometimes even compete on friendly rivalries on who gets the highest score in our subjects.</p>
        <p>Speaking of subjects, my dominant subject is Mathematics. It is also the subject where me and my classmates or my closest friends compete on, on who gets the highest score on our seatworks, assignments, summatives, and exams. Mathematics is the subject that I shine on. Because I understand it better than literary subjects like English or Filipino. It is very hard for me to understand words as I somewhat lack comprehension. And also sometimes in my eyes words disappear or shift from places making it really hard to read or understand. So I struggle a lot with those subjects. But I am still able to get passing grades and sometimes high grades in those literary subjects.</p>
        <p>Even though I am weak on literary subjects, I sometimes like to make short and simple poetry on what I am feeling at the moment. As a way of calming myself and expressing myself.</p>
        <p>I also like watching anime. Some of my favorites are Jujutsu Kaisen, Silent Voice, Blue Lock, Tokyo Ghoul, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, and many more. I personally recommend you to watch the animes listed here, especially Silent Voice and Cyberpunk Edgerunners. I also like stories with something tragic and somewhat dark in them, like Tokyo Ghoul, Goodnight Punpun, 3 Days of Happiness, etc.</p>
